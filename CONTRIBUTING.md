## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.  
We aim to maintain a welcoming and collaborative environment.

## Coding Style

Anikeen follows the PSR-2 coding standard and the PSR-4 autoloading standard.

### PHPDoc

Below is an example of a valid Anikeen documentation block.

```php
/**
 * Register a binding with the container.
 *
 * @param string|array $abstract
 * @param \Closure|string|null $concrete
 * @param bool $shared
 * @return void
 *
 * @throws \Exception
 */
public function bind($abstract, $concrete = null, $shared = false)
{
    // ...
}
```

When the `@param` or `@return` attributes are redundant due to the use of native types, they can be removed:

```php
/**
 * Execute the job.
 */
public function handle(AudioProcessor $processor): void
{
    //
}
```

However, when the native type is generic, please specify the generic type through the use of the `@param` or `@return`
attributes:

```php
/**
 * Get the attachments for the message.
 *
 * @return array<int, \Anikeen\Example\Attachment>
 */
public function attachments(): array
{
    return [
        Attachment::fromStorage('/path/to/file'),
    ];
}
```
